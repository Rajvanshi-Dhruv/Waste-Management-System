1. Introduction
 
 Project Report: Waste Classification Model
 
 The Waste Classification Model is designed to categorize waste materials into two categories:
 recyclable and non-recyclable. This model uses computer vision to automate waste categorization,
 helping streamline waste management processes by reducing the need for manual sorting and
 improving recycling efficiency.

 2. Objective

 To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of waste as either
 recyclable or non-recyclable.
 
 3. Methodology

 3.1 Data Collection and Preparation
 1. Dataset: The dataset used consists of images in two categories:
   - B (Biodegradable)
   - N (Non-biodegradable)
 2. Preprocessing:
   - Images are resized to 60x60 pixels for consistency.
   - Normalization is applied by scaling pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
   - The dataset is divided into training and test sets.
 
 
 3.2 Model Architecture

 The model is based on VGG16, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). VGG16 is
 modified to suit the binary classification task as follows:
   - Base Model: VGG16 layers are set as non-trainable to leverage pre-learned features.
   - Added Layers: A Flatten layer followed by a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation
 function for binary classification.

 3.3 Training and Evaluation

 1. Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy is used as the loss function since this is a binary
 classification problem.
2. Optimizer: Adam optimizer is chosen for efficient gradient descent.
 3. Early Stopping: Added to monitor validation accuracy, with patience set to prevent
 overfitting.
 
 3.4 Evaluation Metrics

 The model's performance is evaluated using:
   - Confusion Matrix: Provides insight into misclassifications between biodegradable and
 non-biodegradable categories.
   - Classification Report: Summarizes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
 4. Results-
 Confusion Matrix and Classification Report:
   - The confusion matrix and classification report indicate that the model can
 reasonably distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable materials,
 although some misclassifications may occur.
   - Precision and recall values give insight into the model's accuracy in each
 category.
 5. Conclusion

 The Waste Classification Model demonstrates a promising approach to
 automated waste categorization, potentially aiding in efficient waste
 management and recycling.
 
 Future work can focus on:
  
   - Improving Model Accuracy: By tuning hyperparameters or experimenting
 with other CNN architectures.
   - Enhanced Categorization: Expanding to finer categories within
 non-recyclable waste (e.g., energy production suitability).
   - Real-World Testing: Validating model performance with a broader range of
waste types in practical settings.
